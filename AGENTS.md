# Kids Development Directory

Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of what you will do; keep items conceptual, not implementation-level.
This project is designed to create a centralized, indexed directory of resources to support parents in their child's development. The core objective is to scrape and aggregate useful content from multiple reputable websites, presenting it in a standardized and easily searchable format.
## Output Format
Generate a JSON array, where each object represents an individual resource entry. Each resource entry should include the following fields:
- "title": The title of the resource.
- "url": The direct URL to the resource.
- "description": A concise summary of the resource.
- "category": The primary category or topic (e.g., education, health, activities).
- "source": The originating website's name.
- "indexed_tags": An array of keywords or tags for search and indexing.
If a resource cannot be fully scraped, or any required information is unavailable, include an entry with an "error" field containing a description of the issue, as well as any partial information that could be retrieved.
### Example Output
```json
[
{
"title": "Learning Games for Kids",
"url": "https://example.com/learning-games",
"description": "A collection of games to help children develop cognitive skills.",
"category": "education",
"source": "example.com",
"indexed_tags": ["games", "learning", "cognitive development"]
},
{
"url": "https://problematic-website.com/resource",
"error": "Failed to scrape the website due to access restrictions."
}
]
```
## Additional Instructions
- Ensure all scraped data is as current and accurate as possible.
- Respect robots.txt and legal constraints on each website before scraping.
- If partial data is available, provide what you can along with the error message.
- Format the JSON for readability (pretty-print).
- Only output the JSON arrayâ€”no extra commentary or metadata.
After generating the output, validate that the JSON strictly conforms to the required schema and no extra commentary or metadata is present. If formatting or informational errors are detected, self-correct and regenerate.
