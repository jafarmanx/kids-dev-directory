# Your Baby's First Year: A Parent's Guide to Milestones, Activities, and Developmental Assessments

**Introduction:** The first year of life is a time of astonishing growth and learning. Babies transform from newborns who can barely lift their heads into curious one-year-olds taking first steps. Along the way, they achieve *developmental milestones* – skills or behaviors that most children can do by a certain age. These milestones span a wide range of areas: social/emotional (how they interact and express feelings), language/communication, cognitive (learning and problem-solving), and physical development. For example, rolling over, sitting up, babbling, and waving “bye-bye” are all first-year milestones. It’s important to remember that each baby is unique. Some may reach certain milestones faster or slower, especially if they were born prematurely (in which case milestones are often measured from their due date rather than birth date). **About 80% of a child’s brain development happens by age 3**, so these early experiences – hearing language, being held and comforted, exploring their environment – are crucial for building your baby’s brain. In this guide, we break down the first year into stages with key milestones, ways to encourage your baby’s development, and tools to track progress. Supporting your baby with a loving, stimulating environment and regular health check-ups will set them on the path for healthy growth and learning.

## Newborn to 3 Months: The Newborn Stage

During the first three months, your newborn is adapting to life outside the womb. At first, much of their time is spent eating, sleeping, and crying, but soon you’ll notice them becoming more alert and responsive. Babies learn to recognize familiar faces and voices, and they start gaining control of their tiny bodies. By the end of this stage, many infants can briefly lift their head and chest while on their tummy and give social smiles to engage with caregivers.

### Key Milestones (0–3 Months):
- **Social & Emotional:** Begin to smile in response to you and calm down when comforted. They may gaze at your face with interest and recognize your voice.
- **Language & Communication:** Start cooing and gurgling besides just crying. Turn their head toward your voice or a loud sound.
- **Cognitive (Learning):** Focus on faces and high-contrast objects. May bring their hands to their mouth to explore.
- **Physical (Motor Skills):** Gain better head control. May lift their head during tummy time and grasp a rattle placed in their hand.

### Activities to Support Development:
- Bond through touch and comfort.
- Talk and sing to your baby.
- Encourage visual tracking with toys.
- Provide daily tummy time.
- Offer gentle sensory experiences.

### Tracking & Assessment:
- Use milestone checklists (CDC Milestone Tracker app).
- Discuss concerns with your pediatrician, especially if baby is not smiling, reacting to sounds, or tracking objects by 3 months.

## 4 to 6 Months: Baby Becomes More Interactive

By 4 months, babies become more social and active, starting to laugh, babble, and grab objects. Physical control improves, leading to rolling over and sitting with support.

- **Visual & Cognitive:** Tracks moving objects, recognizes familiar people at a distance.

### Activities to Support Development:

- Offer safe toys for grasping and mouthing.
- Read daily with picture books.
