# Newborn Reflexes

**Age range:** 0-6 months (some reflexes up to 24 months)

**Key points:**
- Newborns display automatic reflexes such as grasping, Moro startle, stepping, rooting, Babinski, and palmar responses.
- These reflexes fade as the nervous system matures; Moro and palmar reflexes vanish by about 6 months, rooting by 4 months, stepping by 2 months, and Babinski by 2 years.
- Recognizing these reflexes helps caregivers track typical neurological development.
