**General Development & Learning:**
*   Toddlers undergo significant changes in their thinking, learning, social, and emotional abilities, which help them explore and make sense of their world.
*   Encourage your toddler to explore and try new things.
*   Help your child learn new words by talking with them and adding to the words they use. For example, if they say "baba," you can respond, "Yes, you are rightâ€”that is a bottle."
*   Ask them to find objects for you or name body parts and objects.
*   Play matching games with your toddler, such as shape sorting and simple puzzles.
*   Encourage pretend play.
*   Read books with your toddler regularly.
*   Teach simple songs and nursery rhymes.
*   Encourage free play to help them stay active, strong, and develop motor skills.
*   Help your child develop independence by letting them assist with dressing and feeding themselves.

**Social & Emotional Development:**
*   Give your child attention and praise when they follow instructions and show positive behavior, and limit attention for defiant behavior like tantrums.
*   Teach your child acceptable ways to show they are upset.
*   Allow your toddler to play with other children to learn social skills like sharing and taking turns.
*   Tantrums are a normal part of development; use distractions to minimize them.

**Health & Safety:**
*   Keep a close eye on your child as they become more mobile, as dangerous situations can happen quickly.
*   Encourage your toddler to sit when eating and chew food thoroughly to prevent choking.
*   Check toys often for loose or broken parts.
*   Do not hold hot drinks while your child is on your lap.
*   Give your child water and plain milk instead of sugary drinks.
*   Offer a selection of healthy foods and let them choose what they want, as toddlers may become picky eaters.
*   Do not leave your toddler near water (bathtubs, pools, etc.) without supervision.
*   Block off stairs with gates and lock doors to dangerous areas like garages or basements.
*   Poison-proof your home, paying attention to child-level cabinets and never storing toxic substances in food-like containers.
