# Preschool Development

The Child Development Institute website provides information on developmental milestones for preschoolers, focusing on ages and stages. They highlight that 3- and 4-year-old children experience rapid developmental changes as they prepare for school. The site emphasizes the importance of parents being present and engaged, suggesting activities like reading, interacting, cuddling, and creating things together to enhance social-emotional development. For 3-year-olds, they recommend encouraging children to identify their own emotions and those of others, playing turn-taking games, and discussing how to work through problems.
