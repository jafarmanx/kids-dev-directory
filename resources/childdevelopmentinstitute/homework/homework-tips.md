Here are some homework tips from childdevelopmentinfo.com:

*   **Create a study space:** Designate a specific, tech-free area for homework and studying, keeping all essential tools within reach.
*   **Establish a routine:** Choose a consistent time each day for homework, whether it's right after school or after dinner, depending on your child's schedule.
*   **Help them make a plan:** Encourage your child to break down large assignments into manageable chunks and create a work schedule.
*   **Minimize distractions:** Turn off TVs, silence phones and tablets, and avoid loud music to help your child focus.
*   **Be available for questions:** Be present to answer questions and clarify assignments, but ensure your child does their own work to foster independence.
*   **Take breaks:** Encourage short breaks (e.g., 10-15 minutes every hour) to help maintain focus and energy.
*   **Gather all necessary materials:** Before starting, collect everything needed for the homework to avoid interruptions.
*   **Be a motivator and monitor:** Ask about assignments, offer encouragement, check completed work, and praise their efforts.
*   **Set a good example:** Model good study habits by letting your children see you reading or managing your own tasks.
*   **Seek help if needed:** If homework problems persist, talk to your child's teacher, as there might be underlying issues like vision problems or learning difficulties.
