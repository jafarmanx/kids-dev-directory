# Teaching Life Skills

The Child Development Institute (childdevelopmentinfo.com) provides a comprehensive list of ideas for teaching life skills to youth across different age groups (8-10, 11-14, 15-18, and 19+). These ideas are adapted from Casey Family Programs (2001) and their guide "Ready, Set, Fly! A Parent's Guide to Teaching Life Skills."

The suggestions cover various aspects of life skills, including:
*   **Career and Education:** Attending career fairs, filling out job applications, discussing different jobs, being involved in school, and encouraging post-high school education.
*   **Daily Living Skills:** Discussing manners, using tools for home repairs, developing chore charts, and teaching public transportation use.
*   **Financial Literacy:** Evaluating banks, writing checks, balancing checkbooks, using online banking, saving money, and understanding credit.
