This article discusses the visible aspects of child development, such as height, weight, and the development of fine and gross motor skills. It emphasizes the link between physical development and brain development, noting that exploration and movement stimulate neurogenesis and synaptogenesis.

Parents play a crucial role in physical development by providing a safe environment for exploration, offering positive feedback, and "scaffolding" their child's learning through activities like teaching them to walk or ride a bike. The article also highlights the importance of promoting a healthy lifestyle, including adequate sleep, a balanced diet, and physical activity, with parents modeling these behaviors. Safety, regular check-ups, and immunizations are also stressed.

The article provides tips for parents to encourage physical development, such as playing games that promote motor skills, providing age-appropriate toys, limiting screen time, and encouraging participation in sports and outdoor activities. It also lists recommended books and outlines physical developmental milestones from birth to 18 years, detailing gross and fine motor skills expected at different ages.
