**For Infants (Birth â€“ 2 years):**
*   Encourage experimentation with toys such as nesting cups, activity boxes, stacking rings, and large blocks to help develop fine motor skills and an understanding of object relationships.
*   Utilize cloth or board books featuring pictures of faces or familiar objects to aid in object recognition and introduce fundamental language concepts.
*   Bathtub toys are beneficial for water play, including filling, emptying, and splashing.
*   Focus on building lasting bonds with your child, which helps provide them with the internal resources necessary for self-esteem and positive relationships.
*   Parents should strive to understand, respect, support, and encourage their child's unique characteristics and abilities.
