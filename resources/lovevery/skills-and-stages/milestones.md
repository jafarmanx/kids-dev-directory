# Developmental Milestones

## What are Developmental Milestones?

Developmental milestones are skills that most children can do by a certain age. They include skills in these areas:

*   **Gross motor skills:** Using large muscles to sit, stand, walk, run, etc.
*   **Fine motor skills:** Using small muscles to eat, draw, play with toys, etc.
*   **Language skills:** Speaking, understanding, and communicating.
*   **Social and emotional skills:** Playing, feeling, and interacting with others.

## Why are Milestones Important?

Milestones can help you track your child's development and identify any potential problems early. However, it's important to remember that every child develops at their own pace.

## What to do if You're Concerned

If you're concerned about your child's development, talk to your pediatrician. They can help you determine if there's a problem and what to do about it.
