# Pulling to a Stand: A Guide for 9-10 Months

## When do babies start pulling to a stand?

Most babies start pulling to a stand between 9 and 10 months old. This is an important milestone that will help them get ready to walk.

## How to Encourage Pulling to a Stand

*   **Create a safe environment:** Make sure your home is baby-proofed so your baby can explore safely.
*   **Place toys on low furniture:** This will encourage your baby to pull themselves up to get them.
*   **Get down on the floor with your baby:** This will encourage them to move and explore.
*   **Don't rush it:** Every baby develops at their own pace. Don't try to force your baby to pull to a stand before they are ready.

## Safety Tips

*   Make sure that all furniture is sturdy and can't be pulled over.
*   Cover all sharp corners on furniture.
*   Never leave your baby unattended.
