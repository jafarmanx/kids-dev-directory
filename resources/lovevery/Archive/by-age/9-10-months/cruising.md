# Cruising: A Guide for 9-10 Months

## What is cruising?

Cruising is when your baby walks while holding onto furniture. It's an important pre-walking skill that will help them develop their balance and coordination.

## How to Encourage Cruising

*   **Create a safe environment:** Make sure your home is baby-proofed so your baby can explore safely.
*   **Arrange furniture so that your baby can cruise from one piece to another:** This will encourage them to let go of one piece of furniture and reach for the next.
*   **Place toys on furniture:** This will motivate your baby to cruise to get them.
*   **Don't rush it:** Every baby develops at their own pace. Don't try to force your baby to cruise before they are ready.

## Safety Tips

*   Make sure that all furniture is sturdy and can't be pulled over.
*   Cover all sharp corners on furniture.
*   Never leave your baby unattended.
