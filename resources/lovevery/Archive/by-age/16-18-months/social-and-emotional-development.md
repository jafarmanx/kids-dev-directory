# Social and Emotional Development for 16-18 Month Olds

*   **Attachment and Independence:** Children at this age have strong emotional attachments to their caregivers. They may move away to play but will look to make sure you are nearby. Separation anxiety is also common and can peak around 18 months.
*   **Intense Emotions:** Toddlers may have intense and impulsive emotions. Naming their feelings can help them understand and manage their emotions.
*   **Daily Routines:** They will participate more easily in daily routines like washing their hands and getting dressed.
