# Visual Development: A Guide for 0-12 Weeks

## What can my baby see?

In the first few weeks of life, your baby's vision is still developing. They can see best at a distance of 8 to 12 inches, which is about the distance from your face to theirs when you are holding them.

## How to Stimulate Your Baby's Vision

*   **High-contrast images:** Black and white images are easiest for your baby to see.
*   **Faces:** Your baby loves to look at faces, especially yours.
*   **Mirrors:** Babies are fascinated by their own reflection.
*   **Mobiles:** A mobile with high-contrast colors and simple shapes can be a great way to stimulate your baby's vision.

## Milestones

*   **Birth to 4 weeks:** Your baby can focus on objects that are close to their face.
*   **1 month:** Your baby can track a moving object with their eyes.
*   **2 months:** Your baby can see colors more clearly.
*   **3 months:** Your baby has a wider field of vision and can see objects that are farther away.
