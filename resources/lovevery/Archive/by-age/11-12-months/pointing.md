# Pointing: A Guide for 11-12 Months

## Why is pointing important?

Pointing is an important communication skill that your baby will develop between 11 and 12 months old. It's how they show you what they are interested in.

## How to Encourage Pointing

*   **Point to things yourself:** When you are reading a book or looking at pictures, point to the objects and name them.
*   **Ask your baby questions:** For example, you could say, "Where is the ball?" and then point to the ball.
*   **Get excited when your baby points:** This will show them that you are interested in what they have to say.

## What it Means

When your baby points, it means that they are starting to understand that they can communicate with you. They are also learning that objects have names.
