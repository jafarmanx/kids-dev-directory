# Walking: A Guide for 11-12 Months

## When do babies start walking?

Most babies start walking between 11 and 13 months old. At this age, they have the strength and coordination to take their first steps.

## How to Encourage Walking

*   **Create a safe environment:** Make sure your home is baby-proofed so your baby can explore safely.
*   **Encourage cruising:** Cruising is when your baby walks while holding onto furniture. This is a great way for them to practice their balance and coordination.
*   **Hold their hands:** Hold your baby's hands and walk with them. This will help them get the feel of walking.
*   **Don't rush it:** Every baby develops at their own pace. Don't try to force your baby to walk before they are ready.

## Best Shoes for New Walkers

Barefoot is best for new walkers. When you do need to put shoes on your baby, choose shoes that are flexible and have a non-slip sole.
