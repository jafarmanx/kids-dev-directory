# First Words: A Guide for 11-12 Months

## When do babies say their first words?

Most babies say their first words between 11 and 12 months old. Some may start earlier, and some may take a little longer. Every baby is different.

## How to Encourage First Words

*   **Talk to your baby all day long:** The more words your baby hears, the more they will learn.
