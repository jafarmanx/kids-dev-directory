# Language and Communication for 34-36 Month Olds

*   **Language and Communication:** Children at this age will refine their speech, confidently use pronouns like "I," "me," and "you," and begin to construct three-word sentences, making their conversations more detailed. They learn new words quickly, can follow simple requests, and may know around 450 words by 30 months.
