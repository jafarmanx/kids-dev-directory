# Pre-Reading Skills: A Guide for 3-Year-Olds

## What are Pre-Reading Skills?

Pre-reading skills are the skills that children need to develop before they can learn to read. These skills include:

*   **Print awareness:** The understanding that print has meaning.
*   **Letter knowledge:** The ability to recognize and name the letters of the alphabet.
*   **Phonological awareness:** The ability to hear and play with the smaller sounds in words.
*   **Vocabulary:** The knowledge of words and their meanings.
*   **Narrative skills:** The ability to understand and tell stories.

## How to Encourage Pre-Reading Skills

*   **Read to your child every day:** This is the most important thing you can do to help your child develop pre-reading skills.
*   **Talk to your child all day long:** The more words your child hears, the more they will learn.
*   **Sing songs and nursery rhymes:** This is a fun way for your child to learn about language.
*   **Play with letters and sounds:** For example, you could play with magnetic letters on the fridge, or you could make up silly rhymes.

## Tips for Success

*   **Make it fun:** Learning should be fun! Play games and do activities that your child enjoys.
*   **Be patient:** It takes time for children to develop pre-reading skills.
*   **Follow your child's lead:** Pay attention to what your child is interested in and build on that.
