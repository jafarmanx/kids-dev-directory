# Separation Anxiety: A Guide for 7-8 Months

## What is separation anxiety?

Separation anxiety is a normal stage of development that most babies go through between 7 and 18 months old. It's when your baby gets upset when you leave them.

## How to Cope with Separation Anxiety

*   **Practice short separations:** Start by leaving your baby for a few minutes at a time, and then gradually increase the amount of time you are away.
*   **Create a goodbye routine:** A consistent goodbye routine will help your baby know what to expect.
*   **Don't sneak away:** This can make your baby's anxiety worse.
*   **Stay calm:** Your baby will pick up on your emotions. If you are calm, it will help your baby to be calm.

## When to be Concerned

If your baby's separation anxiety is severe or is not getting better, talk to your pediatrician.
