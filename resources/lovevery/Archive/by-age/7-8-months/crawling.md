# Crawling: A Guide for 7-8 Months

## When do babies start crawling?

Most babies start crawling between 7 and 10 months old. However, some babies may skip crawling altogether and go straight to walking.

## How to Encourage Crawling

*   **Tummy time:** This is the most important thing you can do to help your baby develop the muscles they need to crawl.
*   **Get down on the floor with your baby:** This will encourage them to move and explore.
*   **Place toys just out of reach:** This will motivate your baby to crawl to get them.
*   **Create a safe environment:** Make sure your home is baby-proofed so your baby can explore safely.

## Types of Crawling

*   **Belly crawl:** This is when your baby crawls on their belly.
*   **Scoot:** This is when your baby scoots on their bottom.
