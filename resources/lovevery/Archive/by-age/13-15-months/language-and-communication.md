# Language and Communication for 13-15 Month Olds

Language skills are rapidly expanding during this period. A toddler's babbling will start to include real words, and they may be able to say a few words correctly. They can understand when you name familiar objects and can follow simple directions, especially when accompanied by gestures. Pointing and other gestures are still a primary way for them to communicate their needs. They will look at familiar objects when you name them and can follow simple directions that are accompanied by gestures.
