# Social and Emotional Development for 19-21 Month Olds

This period is marked by significant emotional and social growth. Toddlers start to develop self-awareness and a better understanding of "you" and "me". They may play alongside other children rather than directly with them, which is a normal part of learning to interact socially. They also begin to show empathy and may look to their caregivers for emotional cues in new situations.
