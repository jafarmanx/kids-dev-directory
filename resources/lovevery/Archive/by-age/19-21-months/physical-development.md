# Physical Development for 19-21 Month Olds

Physically, you can expect your toddler to continue their steady growth. On average, 19-month-old girls weigh around 10.4 kg and are 81.7 cm tall, while boys of the same age weigh about 11.1 kg and are 83.2 cm tall. By 20 months, these figures increase to approximately 10.6 kg and 82.7 cm for girls, and 11.3 kg and 84.2 cm for boys.

*   **Motor Skills**: Stacking blocks, taking toys apart and putting them back together, running, standing on tiptoes, and kicking a large ball are common physical feats. They may also begin to walk up stairs with support and scribble.
*   **Fine Motor Skills**: Many toddlers at this age are learning to use their hands and fingers to manipulate toys with buttons and gears. They can also turn the pages of a book and may begin to feed themselves with a spoon.
