# Sitting Up: A Guide for 5-6 Months

## When do babies start sitting up?

Most babies start sitting up with support between 5 and 6 months old. They will be able to sit up on their own for a few minutes at a time by 7 or 8 months old.

## How to Encourage Sitting Up

*   **Tummy time:** This is the most important thing you can do to help your baby develop the muscles they need to sit up.
*   **Prop your baby up:** You can prop your baby up with pillows or in a special seat that is designed for babies who are learning to sit up.
*   **Play with your baby on the floor:** This will give them plenty of space to move and explore.
*   **Use toys to encourage your baby to sit up:** Place toys just out of reach to encourage your baby to sit up to get them.

## Safety Tips

*   Never leave your baby unattended on a high surface, like a bed or changing table.
*   Once your baby starts sitting up, make sure that your home is baby-proofed.
