# Object Exploration: A Guide for 5-6 Months

## What is object exploration?

Object exploration is when your baby uses their senses to learn about objects. They will look at objects, touch them, and put them in their mouth.

## How to Encourage Object Exploration

*   **Provide a variety of toys:** Offer your baby toys of different shapes, sizes, and textures.
*   **Let your baby get messy:** Let your baby play with food, water, and other safe materials.
*   **Talk to your baby about what they are seeing and doing:** This will help them learn new words and concepts.
*   **Create a treasure basket:** Fill a basket with a variety of safe objects for your baby to explore.

## Safety Tips

*   Always supervise your baby when they are playing with small objects.
*   Make sure that any objects you give your baby are large enough that they can't be swallowed.
