# Language and Communication for 25-27 Month Olds

*   **Language Development:** A 25-month-old may use simple phrases and have a vocabulary of 50 to 100 words. By 26 months, most children have a vocabulary of 50 or more words and can combine two words into a simple sentence. At 27 months, their vocabulary continues to expand, and they may stutter or mix up the order of words in a sentence as they learn.
