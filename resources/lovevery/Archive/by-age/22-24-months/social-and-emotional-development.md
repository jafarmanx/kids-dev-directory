# Social and Emotional Development for 22-24 Month Olds

*   **Independence:** Toddlers at this age are testing limits and like to have their own way. It's beneficial to encourage their independence while supervising them.
*   **Pretend Play:** A new era of pretend play begins, based on their own experiences. They enjoy imitating actions like sweeping or "reading" a book.
