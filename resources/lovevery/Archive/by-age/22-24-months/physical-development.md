# Physical Development for 22-24 Month Olds

*   **Gross Motor:** Children in this age range can typically walk up and down stairs while holding on, run fairly well, and may even walk backward a few steps. They might also be able to kick a ball, stand on their tiptoes, and jump in place.
*   **Fine Motor:** The pincer grasp continues to develop, which is important for future writing skills. They can help dress themselves, use a spoon and fork, and scribble on paper.
