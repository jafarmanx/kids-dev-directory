# Language and Communication for 16-18 Month Olds

*   **Vocabulary:** While it varies greatly from child to child, your toddler may be able to say several words. You'll likely hear more real words mixed in with their babbling. They may also be able to combine two words, like "go bye-bye".
*   **Understanding:** They begin to follow simple commands without gestures and start to understand their own name. They might also let you know when their diaper is wet.
*   **Imitation:** Toddlers at this age often copy gestures and sounds.
