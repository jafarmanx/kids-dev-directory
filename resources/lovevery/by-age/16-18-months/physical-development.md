# Physical Development for 16-18 Month Olds

*   **Mobility:** Toddlers at this age often begin to walk without holding on and may attempt to run or climb stairs with support. They can also get on and off a chair without assistance. Some may even start to creep downstairs backward.
*   **Coordination:** You'll likely see your child's coordination improve. They may be able to throw a ball while sitting or standing, and they get better at pushing small chairs. They will also become more confident in scribbling, drinking from a cup, using a spoon, and turning the pages of a book.
