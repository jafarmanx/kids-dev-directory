# Cognitive Development for 16-18 Month Olds

*   **Curiosity and Play:** This is an age of great curiosity and exploration. Toddlers will play with toys in a more meaningful way, like feeding a doll or pushing a toy car. They also engage in pretend play, such as mimicking eating with a toy spoon, and may copy household chores they see you doing.
*   **Problem-Solving:** Through play, they develop imagination, creativity, and problem-solving skills.
