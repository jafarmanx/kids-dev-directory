*   **Problem-Solving:** Toddlers may demonstrate simple problem-solving skills, such as using a stool to reach for something.
*   **Pretend Play:** Their imaginative play becomes more intentional, and they might use objects to pretend, like feeding a doll with a block.
*   **Following Instructions:** They can typically follow two-step instructions, such as "pick up the toy and put it on the shelf."
