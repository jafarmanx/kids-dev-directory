## Tips for Better Sleep

*   **Create a bedtime routine:** A consistent bedtime routine will help your baby know that it's time to sleep.
*   **Put your baby to bed drowsy but awake:** This will help them learn to fall asleep on their own.
*   **Make sure your baby is getting enough to eat during the day:** A full tummy will help your baby sleep longer at night.
*   **Be patient:** It takes time for babies to develop a regular sleep pattern.
