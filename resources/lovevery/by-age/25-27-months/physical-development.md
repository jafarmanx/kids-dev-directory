# Physical Development for 25-27 Month Olds

*   **Motor Skills:** Expect your toddler to run more smoothly and begin to jump with both feet off the ground. They can likely throw a ball overhand and are getting better at climbing and walking up and down stairs.
*   **Fine Motor Skills:** Fine motor skills are also developing, and they may be able to hold a pencil with their thumb and forefinger.
