# Object Permanence: A Guide for 9-10 Months

## What is Object Permanence?

Object permanence is the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they can't be seen. It's a major cognitive milestone that your baby will reach between 9 and 10 months old.

## How to Encourage Object Permanence

*   **Play peek-a-boo:** This classic game is a great way to teach your baby about object permanence.
*   **Hide toys:** Hide a toy under a blanket and see if your baby can find it.
*   **Talk about objects that are out of sight:** For example, you could say, "Daddy is in the other room," or "The dog is under the table."

## Games to Play

*   **Jack-in-the-box:** This toy is a great way to surprise your baby and teach them about object permanence.
*   **Lift-the-flap books:** These books are a fun way for your baby to practice finding hidden objects.
