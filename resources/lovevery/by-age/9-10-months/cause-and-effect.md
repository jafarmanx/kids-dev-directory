# Cause and Effect: A Guide for 9-10 Months

## What is cause and effect?

Cause and effect is the understanding that one event can cause another event to happen. It's a major cognitive milestone that your baby will reach between 9 and 10 months old.

## How to Encourage Understanding of Cause and Effect

*   **Play with toys that have a clear cause and effect:** For example, a toy that makes a sound when you press a button.
*   **Talk to your baby about cause and effect:** For example, you could say, "You pushed the button, and the toy made a sound."
*   **Let your baby experiment:** Let your baby drop things from their high chair and see what happens.

## Games to Play

*   **Rolling a ball back and forth:** This is a simple game that can help your baby understand cause and effect.
*   **Pushing a toy car:** This is another simple game that can help your baby understand cause and effect.
