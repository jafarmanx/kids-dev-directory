# Self-Feeding: A Guide for 7-8 Months

## When do babies start self-feeding?

Most babies start to show an interest in self-feeding between 7 and 8 months old. They will be able to feed themselves with their fingers and will start to use a spoon.

## How to Encourage Self-Feeding

*   **Offer finger foods:** Small, soft pieces of food are great for practicing self-feeding.
*   **Let your baby get messy:** This is part of the learning process.
*   **Eat together as a family:** Your baby will learn by watching you.
*   **Be patient:** It takes time for babies to learn to feed themselves.

## Best First Finger Foods

*   Small pieces of soft fruit, such as banana and avocado.
*   Small pieces of cooked vegetables, such as carrots and sweet potatoes.
*   O-shaped cereal.
*   Small pieces of toast.
