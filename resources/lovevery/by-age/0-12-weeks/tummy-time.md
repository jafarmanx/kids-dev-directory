# Tummy Time for 0-12 Weeks

## Why is Tummy Time Important?

Tummy time is essential for your baby's development. It helps them:

*   Strengthen their neck, shoulder, and back muscles.
*   Develop motor skills like rolling, crawling, and sitting up.
*   Prevent flat spots on the back of their head.

## How to Do Tummy Time

*   Start with short sessions of 1-2 minutes, a few times a day.
*   Place your baby on their tummy on a firm, flat surface.
*   Get down on their level to encourage them and make eye contact.
*   Use toys and books to keep them engaged.

## Tips for Success

*   Choose a time when your baby is happy and alert.
*   Avoid tummy time right after a feeding.
*   If your baby fusses, try again later.
