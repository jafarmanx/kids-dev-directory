# Motor Skills: A Guide for 0-12 Weeks

## What are motor skills?

Motor skills are the skills that allow your baby to move and control their body. They are divided into two categories: gross motor skills and fine motor skills.

## Gross Motor Skills

Gross motor skills involve the large muscles of the body. In the first 12 weeks, your baby will be working on:

*   **Head control:** The ability to hold their head up on their own.
*   **Reflexes:** Your baby is born with a number of reflexes, such as the rooting reflex and the sucking reflex.
*   **Tummy time:** This is essential for developing the muscles your baby needs for rolling, crawling, and sitting up.

## Fine Motor Skills

Fine motor skills involve the small muscles of the body. In the first 12 weeks, your baby will be working on:

*   **Grasping:** Your baby will be able to grasp your finger or a rattle.
*   **Hand-to-mouth coordination:** Your baby will be able to bring their hands to their mouth.
