# Reaching and Grasping: A Guide for 3-4 Months

## What is reaching and grasping?

Reaching and grasping are important motor skills that your baby will develop between 3 and 4 months old. Reaching is the ability to extend their arms towards an object, and grasping is the ability to hold onto it.

## How to Encourage Reaching and Grasping

*   **Provide a variety of toys:** Offer your baby toys of different shapes, sizes, and textures.
*   **Place toys just out of reach:** This will encourage your baby to reach for them.
*   **Play with your baby on the floor:** This will give them plenty of space to move and explore.
*   **Use a play gym:** A play gym with hanging toys is a great way to encourage reaching and grasping.

## Milestones

*   **3 months:** Your baby will start to bat at objects with their hands.
*   **4 months:** Your baby will be able to purposefully reach for and grasp objects.
