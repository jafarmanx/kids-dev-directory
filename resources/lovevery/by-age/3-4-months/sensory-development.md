# Sensory Development: A Guide for 3-4 Months

## What is sensory development?

Sensory development is the process of learning to use the five senses: sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. It's how your baby learns about the world around them.

## How to Stimulate Your Baby's Senses

*   **Sight:** Provide your baby with a variety of things to look at, such as high-contrast images, faces, and colorful toys.
*   **Hearing:** Talk to your baby, sing to them, and play music.
*   **Smell:** Let your baby smell different scents, such as flowers, fruits, and spices.
*   **Taste:** When your baby starts eating solids, offer them a variety of foods with different tastes and textures.
*   **Touch:** Give your baby plenty of opportunities to touch different textures, such as soft blankets, bumpy balls, and smooth skin.

## Milestones

*   **3 months:** Your baby will be able to track moving objects with their eyes.
*   **4 months:** Your baby will be able to reach for and grasp objects.
