# Rolling Over: A Guide for 3-4 Months

## When do babies start rolling over?

Most babies start rolling over between 3 and 4 months old. Some may start earlier, and some may take a little longer. Every baby is different.

## How to Encourage Rolling Over

*   **Tummy time:** This is the most important thing you can do to help your baby develop the muscles they need to roll over.
*   **Side-lying:** Place your baby on their side to play. This can help them get used to the feeling of being on their side and make it easier for them to roll over.
*   **Use toys:** Place toys just out of reach to encourage your baby to roll over to get them.

## Safety Tips

*   Never leave your baby unattended on a high surface, like a bed or changing table.
*   Once your baby starts rolling over, it's time to stop swaddling.
