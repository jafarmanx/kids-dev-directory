# Babbling and Communication: A Guide for 3-4 Months

## What is babbling?

Babbling is an important pre-language skill that your baby will develop between 3 and 4 months old. It's how they practice making sounds and learn the rhythm and patterns of speech.

## How to Encourage Babbling and Communication

*   **Talk to your baby:** The more you talk to your baby, the more they will learn about language.
*   **Imitate your baby's sounds:** This will show them that you are listening and that you are interested in what they have to say.
*   **Sing songs and nursery rhymes:** This is a fun way for your baby to learn about language.
*   **Read to your baby:** This is a great way to expose your baby to new words and sounds.

## Milestones

*   **3 months:** Your baby will start to coo and gurgle.
*   **4 months:** Your baby will start to babble and make a wider range of sounds.
