This is a crucial time for social and emotional growth. Toddlers at this age start to show empathy and may look sad if they see another person crying. They will often imitate other children during play and show affection with hugs and kisses. Separation anxiety can also be a factor, and they may become upset when a parent leaves. You may also notice the emergence of a unique personality, complete with strong likes and dislikes. You'll notice them imitating other children and playing alongside them. They will show affection with cuddles, kisses, and hugs, but may also experience separation anxiety. Empathy begins to develop as they start to understand and react to the feelings of others.
