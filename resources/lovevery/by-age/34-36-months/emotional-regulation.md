# Emotional Regulation: A Guide for 34-36 Months

## What is Emotional Regulation?

Emotional regulation is the ability to understand and manage your emotions. It's a skill that takes time to develop, but it's an important one for your child to learn.

## How to Teach Your Toddler Emotional Regulation

*   **Name their emotions:** When your child is feeling a strong emotion, help them name it. For example, you could say, "It looks like you're feeling frustrated."
*   **Talk about your own emotions:** This will help your child understand that it's normal to have feelings.
*   **Teach them coping skills:** For example, you could teach them to take deep breaths when they're feeling angry, or to hug a stuffed animal when they're feeling sad.
*   **Read books about emotions:** There are many great books that can help your child learn about emotions.

## Tips for Success

*   **Be patient:** It takes time for toddlers to learn how to regulate their emotions.
*   **Be consistent:** Use the same language and strategies every time your child is feeling a strong emotion.
*   **Model good behavior:** Your child is always watching you. Show them how to manage your own emotions in a healthy way.
